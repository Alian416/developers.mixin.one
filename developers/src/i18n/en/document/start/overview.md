## Get Started

As Mixin is a public blockchain, whose data is fully open to the world, all developers can use the blockchain to develop anything.

Mixin Messenger is the first app developed on the Mixin blockchain. To make things easier for both developers and end users, it's recommended to use the Mixin Messenger Open API to develop your apps.


### Create App
The first step to use the Mixin Messenger Open API is to create an app by visiting the Mixin Developers dashboard https://developers.mixin.one/dashboard.

Give your app a name and description, and define an OAuth callback URL, it may be a standard HTTP(S) link, or your own schema if you want to use the Mixin API in a client app.
